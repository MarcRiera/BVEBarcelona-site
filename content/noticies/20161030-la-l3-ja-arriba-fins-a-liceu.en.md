The new version of the L3 is now available, and it expands the trip to the Catalunya and Liceu stations. We have been working hard during the past months to get the best results in the most complicated part of the line.

Between the Passeig de Gr√†cia and Catalunya stations there is a junction to L4 that was used in the past to operate the Urquinaona, Jaume I and Correos stations. Even though it is not used in regular service anymore, the infrastructure remains intact. Because of this, it was necessary to recreate a very unique tunnel section, so there has been some delay in the work.

However, now you can download the update and enjoy the results. We recommend to turn on the headlights in the tunnel to see the hidden details better.

See you!
