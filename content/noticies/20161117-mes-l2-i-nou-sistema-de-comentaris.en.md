Since the 15th of November a new preview version of the L2 up to Clot station is available. While it includes improvements since the previous version, it is a beta release and may not work correctly. We will try to fix any bug from your feedback.

Also, during the past month we have been testing a new comments system. From now on, comments will not be published on the website, but sent by e-mail so you can get an individual response. The previous system is not compatible with multilanguage websites and hence we have been forced to change it. Comments posted before November will disappear.

See you!
