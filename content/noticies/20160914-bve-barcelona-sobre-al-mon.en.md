Starting from today, all the new content will be published in three languages: Catalan, Spanish and English. This way, BVE Barcelona will reach even more people. The website will be displayed by default in your browser's language, but the language can be changed to any of the other languages using the new buttons below the search bar.

The contents previously available only in Catalan will soon be available in Spanish and English too.
