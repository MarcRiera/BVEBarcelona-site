Starting from today, the L2 by Diego Silvosa (Rodalíes), published last year in Fòrum del Transport Català, is available for download. The route currently includes the original L2 section between Paral·lel and Sagrada Família (around 4.4 km). Diego also built a 9000 series train set to drive on the route.

You will find the route and the train in the downloads section, both as separate or single packages.

See you!
