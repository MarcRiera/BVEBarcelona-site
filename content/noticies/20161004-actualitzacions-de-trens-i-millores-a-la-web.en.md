After the summer, it is time to go back to work, and BVE Barcelona is not an exception. Firstly, the 2000 and 3000 series trains have been updated with a lot of improvements. The most important one is the 2000 series' cab, featuring a revamped ATC panel. Also, the trains now include a trilingual manual with pictures which is available in the manuals section too.

The website translations are now close to being completed. Because many contents were moved, the download pages for trains and routes have been redesigned and now feature attractive menus.

The L3 extension to Catalunya station will be available shortly, as it is near completion.

See you!
