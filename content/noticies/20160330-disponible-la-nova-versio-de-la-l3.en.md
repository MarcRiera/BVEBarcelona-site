A new version of the L3 is available in the downloads section. This version includes an extension to the Diagonal station and allows the player to use the upwards track. Also, tunnels have been improved to make them more realistic, and the signalling has been revamped according to the real world. Finally, you will also be able to drive a version of the L3 with a third rail power supply. This is how the line was operated in the past.

Have a nice trip and see you next time!
